# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification with SVM

This project demonstrates the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. It uses the [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats) from Kaggle and is run entirely within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images as either a "cat" or a "dog" using an SVM model. This project focuses on basic image classification techniques and image preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle. It contains images of cats and dogs organized in separate folders. 

1. **Download the dataset**: [Dogs vs. Cats Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats).
2. **Extract the files** and place them in a folder called `dataset` within the project directory.
3. The folder structure should look like this:
    ```
    dataset/
    ├── cat/
    │   ├── cat.1.jpg
    │   ├── cat.2.jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── dog/
        ├── dog.1.jpg
        ├── dog.2.jpg
        └── ...
    ```

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python 3**
- **Required Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - NumPy (for data manipulation)
  - Scikit-learn (for the SVM model)
  - tqdm (for progress bars during data loading)

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn tqdm
```

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Load and preprocess images**: The Notebook will load images of cats and dogs, resize them for consistency, and prepare them for model training.
2. **Train the SVM classifier**: The SVM model is trained to classify the images based on the features extracted from the images.
3. **Evaluate model performance**: After training, you can test the model and check its accuracy.
